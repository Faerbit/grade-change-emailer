#Grade Change Emailer

This is a simple python script that checks for new grades at the FH Aachen.

##Configuration
Copy the example.ini to default.ini and fill it the necessary details.

##Usage
Run the script with `python3 main.py`.
Now everytime the script runs it checks for new grades and e-mails you about it
if that is the case.  Note that the script will always e-mail you the first
time the script is run. If you don't receive an e-mail, you misconfigured it.
Go and recheck all you login data.
